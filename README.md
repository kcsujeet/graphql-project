<h4>This is my first project in graphql. </h4>
<p>In the first commit I'm just pushing the api.<p>
<ul>The user can do following things with  the <strong>graphql playground</strong>
  <li> Signup</li>
  <li> Login </li>
  <li> Create, Update and Delete Post </li>
  <li> Create, Update and Delete Comment on a Post </li>
</ul>
<p> I plan to do front end part now ( most probably with vue) and after that I will be deploying this to <strong>Heroku.</strong> I will update this readme file with the url then. </p>
